# PLS
C++ implementation of Partial Least Squares (PLS) algorithm.

This C++ implementation is based on the [python implementation](https://engineering.purdue.edu/kak/distPLS/) by Avinash Kak. Both implementations are based on the description of the algorithm by Herve Abdi in the article "Partial Least Squares Regression and Projection on Latent Structure Regression" (Computational Statistics, 2010).
